In the site administration, administrators define queries that selected user can run.<br/>

Then, the results can be fetched through web service.<br/>
This allows for an automated regular fetching, in order that the data can be fed to a data warehouse.</p>

<li>The site must have <a href="../admin/settings.php?section=optionalsubsystems">Web services</a> enabled.</li>
<li>The site must have a <a href="../admin/settings.php?section=webserviceprotocols">Web services protocol</a> (preferrably REST) enabled.</li>
<li>The capability "moodle/webservice:createtoken" should be allowed to the <a href="../admin/roles/manage.php">"Authenticated user"</a> role in order that it\'s possible to generate a security key.</li>
<li>To fetch the provided data<sup><small>*</small></sup>, a user with a <a href="../admin/roles/manage.php">newly created role</a> "Data warehouse webservice user", based on no other role or archetype, and granted the "quiz/datawarehouse:view", "quiz/datawarehouse:viewfiles", as well as "webservice/rest:use" on "System" and "Course" level has to be used. She/he has to include her/his token ("Key") retrieved under <a href="../user/managetoken.php">Security keys</a> in the call.</li>
<li>The administrator defines queries in the <a href="../mod/quiz/report/datawarehouse/query.php">site administration page</a> and give them a distinguishable name.
<li>The capability "quiz/datawarehouse:view" should be allowed to the user that should be able to run a query and to generate a data set out of a quiz.</li>
<li>The web service <a href="../admin/settings.php?section=externalservices">Quiz report datawarehouse functionalities</a> must have the "Can download files" option checked.</li>
<li>To use the web service the token ("Key") retrieved under <a href="../user/managetoken.php">Security keys</a> has to be included in the call <sup><small>**</small></sup>.</li>
